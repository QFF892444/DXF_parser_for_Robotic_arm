Michail J. Beliatis DXF parser/interpreter for ROS. I develope the code as part of a project i worked previously. The code is a python class which can be used with Robot Operating System (ROS) to read drawings in a .DXF file and translate them to trajectories for moving a robotic arm from Fanuc, UR, ABB, etc.
It suports points, lines, circles, arcs, lwpolyline, polyline (only 2D)
